# For-The-People

This is a project developed by my group for Mamie Harper of Carrie's Closet. It is developed in Flutter and utilizes Google Firebase for online storage. This project usitlized a 2-week sprint Agile workplan and used GitHub for collaboration and version control. Each student was responsible for writting implementation code, testing, and collaborating on documentation.

The code folder contains the source code files and some Flutter dependency files. The document folder contains all documentation including system requirement documents, user story/ use case documents, UI documents, and database documents.
